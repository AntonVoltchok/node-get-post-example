const dataStrCombat = '| Captain America | Worth it | Very tanky and a nice DPS boost, but still miles behind others. Needs his newest uni to really shine | Drax | NOT worth it | Not improved enough and other combats are better | Groot | So-so | Great survivability and a decent supporting character. Team heal also heals the whole BW team. However very low DPS and his team buff can now be achieved from obelisks. Has 2 unis which allow him to fit in 3 classes. His Baby uni turns him to speed and really boosts his damage. | Iron Fist | So-so | Good DPS, good at BW and AB. His Hobo uni and a snare resist allow him to score over 100k in ABX | Black Panther | Worth it | 2 I-frames and improved tankiness. The re-spec REALLY helped him all across the board. | Moon Knight | So-so | Great survivability but low DPS, good at BW and AB | Punisher | NOT worth it | much better DPS but still slow and too weak compared to other combat T2. He needs his War Machine uniform to be WORTH IT | Nebula | NOT worth it | decent CC but not enough improvement to make her very useful. | Crossbones | So-so | MUST have his uni to benefit from the T2 crit bonus, otherwise he has low DPS. Fun to play but there are much better options | Hulk | So-so | Real improvement over T1, but still a bit disappointing and lacks damage compared to the other Hulks. Ragnarok uni is a huge improvement and makes him into a top-tier combat. | Red Hulk | Worth it | Multiple good heals and some serious DPS if using his own leadership with a fire boost. Uni turns him into a hero | Hulkling | NOT worth it | Skills are too slow, damage is too low, and poor survivability. Has trouble clearing SL stage 1. | White Tiger | So-so | Worthless without her T2 but still not a huge improvement. Decent DPS and great against single targets. | Venom | So-so | Great damage boost but still lacks defense. The CC he has is a great distraction in Shadowlands. His Anti-Venom turns him into a top tier combat HERO, so he can fill two roles | Carnage | Worth it | Great invincibility and DPS boost. Nearly untouchable. Mandatory if players want a top score in ABX combat villain. | Shang-Chi | So-so | Great damage against single targets but doesn\'t excel in any modes | Giant-Man | NOT worth it | I-frames help his tanking but he still takes a lot of hits | Blade | So-so | Good DPS boost but heal passive is still not strong enough | War Wolf | So-so | A decent boost that benefits the whole team but not a huge improvement to himself. Top teams like to use him to boost ABX scores. | She-Hulk | So-so | Very tanky and exactly how the Hulks should have been from the start, but doesn\'t excel at anything. Still only used for her leadership | Sif | So-so | Does decent damage and good survivability. The uni really helps. | Ulik | So-so | Situational. Can stun-lock heroes in SL but other then that, mediocre. | Hogun | So-so | Great damage and a debuff. | Volstagg | So-so | Nice team boost to defense, but it is best to avoid damage completely instead of just minimizing it. | Hulk Buster | So-so | Solid all-around boost to a mid-tier character | Bullseye | So-so | Great survivability and average DPS from ranged attacks, plus his pierce against immunity is triggered, not permanent | Amadeus Cho | So-so | Great damage and can be built extremely tanky. If you T2 him, get the uni and go for a dodge build. | Luke Cage | Worth it | Good reflect and physical damage immunity. Not a top priority, but a nice niche. Great against Apocalypse and Quicksilver. | Jessica Jones | NOT worth it | A lower tier version of Luke Cage\'s T2. | Doc Oc | So-so | A small buff on his web and a decent damage boost | Kingpin | So-so | A small boost to a outdated, ex-meta character (a la Loki). Luxury, not a priority. | Kamala Kahn | Worth it | A decent damage boost plus a 30% heal makes her really tanky, similar to Moon Knight. Add an invincibility obelisk to her so she won\'t get one-shot killed. | Gorgon | So-so | Depends on stuns and binds so useful in SL but not BW. Basic att and def boost at T2. | Deathlok | NOT worth it | Still lacks DPS and survivability. His shield 5 hits/5 sec only blocks 5 hits of multi-hit attacks. | Agent Venom | Worth it | One of the best combat characters. Great DPS, shield, heal, I-frame... amazing | Beast | So-so | Not required for Jean and weak stats. He is one of the few characters that offers a team buff and isn\'t only used for his buff. Pretty each to naturally T2 him once you are capped on X-men resources | Lizard | So-so | A great T2 that boosts all of his buffs by 25% and duration by 20%. Solid mid-tier character that doesn\'t excel anywhere | Sandman | Worth it | A good all-around character who gets even tankier and an impressive damage boost at T2. | Rhino | Worth it | He is a wrecking ball. The reflect ignore only counters a few niche characters, but his pierce is very useful | Absorbing Man | NOT worth it | a shining example of mediocrity, with a t2 upgrade isn\'t that bad on it\'s own, but given how little else he has, it just isn\'t enough. | Titania | So-so | A very tanky character and very useful in AC thanks to her T2 buffs and heal. A great leadership for any physical team. | Skurge | So-so | If you don\'t have Sandman or Carnage for ABX then he is a good 3rd option. If you do, then he is overshadowed by many other characters in every other mode. The invincibility gained from his T2 makes him very tanky | Valkyrie | Worth it | Good DPS, good survivability and an insane T2 passive that works on ALL ALLIES, not just heroes. | America Chavez | So-so | Decent character but doesn\'t shine in any mode. There are plenty of better choices. | Killmonger | ??? |';
